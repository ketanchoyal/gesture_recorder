# gesture_recorder

**gesture_recorder** enables you to "record" all the gesture event happening during recording.

The recorded data can be replayed, which means you can duplicate exactly the same behavior again and again.

See [README](./packages/gesture_recorder/README.md) in `packages/gesture_recorder/` directory for more details.
